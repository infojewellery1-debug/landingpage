Active learning goes beyond passively absorbing information; it involves actively engaging
with the material to enhance comprehension and retention. Instead of simply reading or 
listening to lectures, active learners seek ways to interact with the content. 
This can include asking questions, participating in discussions, summarizing key points, 
creating mind maps, or teaching the material to someone else. These strategies help to reinforce
learning, identify knowledge gaps, and promote critical thinking. By actively participating
in the learning process, students can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and
improve their academic performance.
